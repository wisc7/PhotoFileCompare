# PhotoFileCompare
Compare 2 directory for duplicate files. (including recursive directory search)  duplicate is flagged if it has the same name and is the same size only.
(should probably do a proper file compare in the future) 

Also contains a preview of image files.

could use a polish add some features/ add some extra smarts (eg open files externally, copy paste etc) 
Seems to have some issues with RAW files, (EG NEF files crash)
